# Stack Exchange data dump downloader and transformer

[![Data dump transformer build](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/se-data-dump-transformer/actions/workflows/transformer.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/se-data-dump-transformer/actions/workflows/transformer.yml) [![Stackapps listing](https://img.shields.io/badge/StackApps%20listing-FF9900)](https://stackapps.com/q/10591/69829)

**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with Stack Exchange, Inc.

## Background

This section contains background on why this project exists. If you know and/or don't care, feel free to skip to the next section.

In June 2023, Stack Exchange [briefly cancelled the data dump](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/389922/332043), and backpedalled after a significant amount of backlash from the community. The status-quo of uploads to archive.org was restored. In the slightly more than a year between June 2023 and July 2024, it looked like they were staying off that path. Notably, they made a [logical shift to the _exact_ dates involved in the upload](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/398279/) to deal with archive.org being slow. In December 2023, they [announced a delay in the upload](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/395197/) likely to avoid speculation that another cancellation was happening.

We appeared to be out of the woods. But this repo wouldn't exist if that was the case now, would it?

### 2024 data dump restriction attempt

In July 2024, Stack Exchange announced the first restrictions on the data dump, by moving it in-house and actively discouraging archive.org reuploads, [likely in violation of the CC-By-SA license](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/401326/332043)

The current revision can be read [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/401324/332043)

Here's what's happening:

- SE is moving the data dump from archive.org to their own infrastructure
- They're discontinuing the archive.org dump, which makes it significantly harder to archive the data if SE, for example, were to go out of business, a threat that's increasing by the day due to SE's continued insistence on ignoring the needs of the community.
  - In addition to discontinuing the archive.org dump, they're imposing significant restrictions on the data dump
- They're doing the first revision **without the possibility to download the entire data dump** in one click, a drastic QOL reduction from the current situation.
- Later in 2024 and in at least the first half of 2025, they've continued scaling up **unreasonably aggressive anti-bot measures**, that also affect the data dump downloader when used in certain countries - even when the browser has full human oversight, and the captchas are solved by a human.
- At the initial time of the release in 2024, Stack Exchange promised to give download links to the entire data dump to anyone who requests it. A network moderator requested it immediately after release. As of May 22nd, 2025, they're _still_ waiting for SE to actually offer the download. This is in spite of several reminders and SE employees claiming they're going to get on it, and upwards of weekly reminders over a period of at least 4-5 months, after which I personally lost track of the frequency as I resigned as moderator on Stack Overflow. **SE has no interest in providing bulk downloads to the community, regardless of the legitimacy of the request**, and the future of data dump archival rests purely on the community's ability to make tooling that combats SE's ridiculous decisions.

This is an opinionated summary of the reason why; SE wants to capitalise on AI companies that need training data, and have decided that the community doesn't matter in that process. The current process, while not nearly as restricting as rev. 1 and 2, is a symptom of precisely one thing; Stack Exchange doesn't care about its users, but rather cares about finding new ways to profit off user data.

**Stack Exchange, Inc. is now the single biggest threat to the community**, and to the platform's user-generated and [permissively-licensed content](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing) that the community has spent countless hours creating precisely _because_ the data is public.

That is why this project exists; this is meant to automate the data dump download process for non-commercial license-compliant use, since Stack Exchange, Inc. couldn't be bothered adding a "download all" button from day 1.

As an added bonus, since this project already exists, there's an accompanying system to automatically convert the data dump to other formats. In my experience, the vast majority of applications building on the data dump do not work directly with the XML. Other, more convenient data formats are often created as an intermediate. Aside using it as an intermediate for various forms of analysis, there are a couple major examples of other distribution forms that are listed later in this README.

While these are preprocessed distributions of the data dump, this project is also meant to help converting to these various formats. While unlikely to replace the source code for either of these two examples, I hope the transformer system here can get rid of boilerplate for other projects.

## Known archives of new data dumps

### Complete data dump archives

A [different project](https://communitydatadump.com/index.html) is currently maintaining a list of both the source data dumps (XML), as well as other distributions. It includes both historical versions of the data dump, as well as new versions uploaded under the new anti-community scheme. In addition, the later data dumps (though exclusively the SE-uploaded ones; not generated variants) [have been uploaded to Academic Torrents](https://academictorrents.com/collection/stack-exchange-data-dumps), which serves as a secondary list.

Note that since someone is uploading an unofficial version to archive.org, you may not need to use the downloader at all. However, to make sure this access continues, I strongly encourage you to download directly from SE anyway if you can -- this helps decrease the chance the uploader is identified and blocked by SE, which will turn into a problem for archival efforts in the long term. It may also decrease the chances SE points to low usage numbers as an excuse to axe the data dump entirely.[^4]

[^4]: There's no guarantee the data dump will continue existing anymore - removing as many justifications to axe the data dump as possible may become increasingly important at some point. Unfortunately, if it is, we won't find out until it's too late by seeing the data dump get axed.

## Using the downloader

Note that it's stongly encouraged that you use a venv. To set one up, run `python3 -m venv env`. After that, you'll need to activate it with one of the activation scripts. Run the appropriate one for your operating system. If you're not sure what the scripts are called, you can find them in `./env/bin`

### Warnings

#### Cloudflare loops

> [!NOTE]
> You should be running into this less as long as you don't provide the `-g`/`--disable-undetected-geckodriver` flag. See "Captchas and other misc. barriers" for details. If you haven't disabled it (i.e. you haven't specified either of the two flags) and still run into this problem, continue reading this section.
>
> If you're a macOS user, leaving undetected-geckodriver enabled will not help. Switch to Windows or Linux (physically or in a VM) and try again there.

---

> TL;DR: If you get a full-page Cloudflare block that loops back to itself after completing the capcha, connect to a VPN, or download the data dump from unofficial community reuploads

If you get a full-page Cloudflare block, and solving the captcha redirects you right back to the cloudflar eblock page even if you complete it correctly, you have to switch to a VPN in another country. For reasons beyond me, SE hard-blocks automated browsers _from specific countries only_. One of the verified blocked countries used for this test was Singapore. 

If you get slapped with a Cloudflare loop, the only option for now is to use a VPN in another country. Switzerland and Norway have both been verified to work at the time of writing. Fascinatingly, using a VPN makes no difference on the looping; it's purely country-based, not anti-VPN-based. The loop has been verified on both a residential IP and a datacenter IP (VPN).

I unfortunately do not (and cannot) write a complete list of countries affected by this bullshit, so you have to test this manually. If you do not have access to a VPN, check https://communitydatadump.com/ or https://academictorrents.com/collection/stack-exchange-data-dumps for archived (unofficial) versions uploaded by the community. They're usually uploaded within a few days to a couple weeks, and unless you're downloading directly from the archive.org version, is significantly faster and more stable than downloading from SE themselves.

#### Download instability, particularly of `stackoverflow.com.7z`

> TL;DR: If `stackoverflow.com.7z` fails to download:
> 1. You're on a good connection: consider connecting to a VPN before retrying.
> 2. You're on a bad connection: consider downloading via the unofficial community torrent instead. It's significantly more resistant to problems caused by bad internet connections.

If you keep running into the download of `stackoverflow.com.7z` failing, you may need to connect to a VPN. For reasons that are not clear (but that are likely down to SE being horrible at implementing things that work), `stackoverflow.com.7z` can just randomly fail. This assumes your device has a stable internet connection for the duration of the download, but arbitrarily fails anyway.

For some reason, connecting with a VPN offers just enough extra stability to avoid whatever causes the failures. This is especially the case if you're on a relatively slow (100Mbps) network, as longer download times increases the chance of failure. If you're on a generally unstable network, a VPN may help, but if it doesn't, it will be significantly easier to download the unofficial community reuploads, as these are always available as torrents. Torrents are generally more resistant to full failure on bad network connections, and can download single missing pieces rather than forcing you to redownload the entire 68+GB thing. 

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer[^3]
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Lots of storage. The 2024Q1 data dump was 92GB compressed.
- A display you can access somehow (physical or virtual, but you need to be able to see it) to be able to solve captchas
- Email and password login for Stack Exchange - Google, Facebook, GitHub, and other login methods are not supported, and will not be supported.
  - If you don't have this, see [this meta question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/1847/332043) for instructions.
- Firefox installed
  - Snap and flatpak users may run into problems; it's strongly recommended to have a non-snap/flatpak installation of Firefox and Geckodriver.
    - **Note:** Some (all?) snap-related problems can be mitigated with `export SE_GECKODRIVER=/snap/bin/geckodriver`. 
    - Known errors:
      - "The geckodriver version may not be compatible with the detected firefox version" - update Firefox and Geckodriver. If this still doesn't work, consider switching to a non-snap installation of Firefox and Geckodriver.
      - "Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded" - One of Geckodriver or Firefox is Snap-based, while the other is not. [Consider switching to a non-snap installation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72531719/6296561) of Firefox, or verifying that your PATH is set correctly.
  - If you need to manaully install Geckodriver (which shouldn't normally be necessary; it's often bundled with Firefox in one way or another), the binaries are on [GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

The downloader does **not** support Docker due to the display requirement.

#### Alternate download: pypi

As of 2.1.0, the downloader has a [pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/sedd). Many of the steps in this README still applies, but anything related to dependency installation don't. You still need to make sure you have Firefox and a `config.json`, as outlined both in this README, and in `README-python.md`. The `config.example.json` template needs to be downloaded manually if you use the pypi download.

```bash
# Optional: set up a venv
python3 -m venv env
# Change appropriately for your operating system
source ./env/bin/activate

# Download the package
python3 -m pip install sedd

# Before running the package, make sure you have Firefox installed, and a `config.json`.
# Running the pypi version is identical to the git version, but it also offers a
# script installed in the venv's `bin` folder.
sedd 
```

### Config, running, and what to expect

#### Configuring and starting

1. Make sure you have all the requirements from the Requirements section.
2. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
3. Open `config.json`, and edit in the values.
4. Run the extractor with `sedd` or `python3 -m sedd`.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you haven't recently updated, it's recommended that you `git pull && pip3 install -r requirements.txt` first. This is not required if this is the first time you're running the tool, as everything will be up-to-date. This goes from being optional to a very good idea or outright required if you run into hard Cloudflare blocks you can't get around. 

##### Config option values

###### `notifications.provider`
Supported values:
* `"native"`: Uses your operating system's native notification method
* `"ntfy"`: Uses ntfy. Requires additional configuration options; see `docs/Notifications.md`
* `null`: Disables notifications. Not recommended, as this will mean any captcha problems requiring your intervention may go unnoticed.

#### CLI options

Exractor CLI supports the following configuration options:

| Short | Long                   | Type     | Default           | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-o`  | `--outputDir <path>`   | Optional | `<cwd>/downloads` | Specifies the directory to download the archives to.                                                                                                                        |
| `-k`  | `--keep-consent`       | Optional | `false`           | Whether to keep OneTrust's consent dialog. If set, you are responsible for getting rid of it yourself (uBlock can handle that for you too).                                 |
| `-s`  | `--skip-loaded <path>` | Optional | -                 | Whether to skip over archives that have already been downloaded. An archive is considered to be downloaded if the output directory has one already & the file is not empty. |
| -     | `--dry-run`            | Optional | -                 | Whether to actually download the archives. If set, only traverses the network's sites.                                                                                      |
| `-g` | `--disable-undetected-geckodriver` | Optional | `false` | Whether or not to disable the anti-anti-bot detection webdriver, and use a fully standard Firefox instead. See "Captchas and other misc. barriers" for more information. Has no effect on macOS. |
| `-v` | - | Optional | `false` | Whether or not to enable verbose logging. You do not want to enable this unless you're diagnosing a problem with sedd - the verbose logging includes low-level Selenium output. |
| - | `--detect <last upload date>` | Optional | - | Enables a mode where sedd checks for the upload timestamp to change, and only then begins the download. This has several caveats. Please read [docs/Automated downloads](docs/Automated downloads.md) for more information before using this feature. |
| `-u` | `--unsupervised` | Optional | false | Rather than notify you about failures and asking you to resolve them, hard failures that would require manual supervision throw an exception instead. |

#### Captchas and other misc. barriers

This software is designed around Selenium, a browser automation tool. This does, however, mean that the program can be stopped by various bot defenses. This would happen even if you downloaded all the [~183 data dumps](https://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday) fully by hand, because it's a _lot_ of repeated operations.

This is where notification systems come in; expecting you to sit and watch for potentially a significant number of hours is not a good use of time. If anything happens, you'll be notified, so you don't have to continuously watch the program. Currently, only a native desktop notifier is supported, but support for other notifiers may be added in the future.

Unfortunately, since the initial release of sedd, Stack Exchange, Inc. has bumped their bot blocking to outright unreasonable levels, which has affected sedd from certain countries. As of 2.0.0, non-macOS users automatically use a non-standard version of Firefox. The only modification done is that the `navigator.webdriver` property is disabled, which is enough to downgrade infinite captcha loops to a single captcha, or no blocking at all.

This can be disabled via the `-g`/`--disable-undetected-geckodriver` flag, **but leaving it on is strongly encouraged**. The alternate webdriver used disables one of the obvious browser-level bot detection flags that Cloudflare uses to send the browser in an infinite captcha loop. Disabling this, depending on how aggressive Stack Exchange's bot blocking has got since this was written, may mean you cannot download the data dump without a VPN into another country (see [Cloudflare loops](#cloudflare-loops))

<details>
<summary>
Technical explanation (and a stab at Stack Exchange, Inc.)
</summary>
As of 2.0.0, <a href="https://github.com/LunarWatcher/undetected_geckodriver/">undetected-geckodriver-lw</a> is used. As described, it's functionally identical to the standard Selenium Firefox driver, except it disables <code>navigator.webdriver</code>. In the future, additional anti-anti-bot measures may be implemented as well, depending on how much needs to be done low-level to avoid detection.

All this does, however, is identify the browser as most likely human. It can and still will run into captcha walls whenever Cloudflare feels like it. But all the obvious, hard, self-announced "hey, I'm a bot" identifiers in the browser are now gone. This is a full nuclear response to SE's nuclear anti-bot actions, that also took down the data dump downloader in several major countries.

Your move, Stack Exchange. I have several contingencies planned if necessary - you will not kill the data dump downloader in any other way than outright killing the data dump itself.
</details>

If you don't run into Cloudflare loops, but instead run into hard blocks or other rate limiting, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/undetected_geckodriver/issues). These blocks are a threat to archival, and I will happily continue to fight against them as far as necessary to ensure access to the data dumps.

#### Storage space

As of Q1 2024, the data dump was a casual 93GB in compressed size. If you have your own system to transform the data dump after downloading, you only need to worry about the raw size of the data dump.

However, if you use the built-in transformer pipeline, you'll need to expect a _lot_ more data use. Depending on how much concurrent processing you do, you may need up to 3-700GB of storage space. It's recommended you have around 1TB **free** on disk to avoid running out, especially if  you're converting to SQLite. JSON or other formats that don't merge `stackoverflow.7z` into a single output file can probably get away with around 500GB. 

The output, by default, is compressed back into 7z if dealing with a file-based transformer. Due to this, an intermediate file write is performed prior to compressing back into a .7z. At runtime, you need:

- The compressed data dump; at least 92GB and increasing with each dump
- The compressed converted data dump; depending on compression rates for the specific format, this anywhere from a little less than the original size to significantly larger
- A significant amount of space for intermediate files. While these will be deleted as soon as they're done and compressed, they'll take up a significant amount of space on the disk in the meanwhile

Note that the transformer pipeline is executed separately; see the transformer section below.

No other formats than .7z are supported at this time, but are planned for some point in the future. 

#### Execution time

One of the major downsides with the way this project functions is that it's subject to Cloudflare bullshit. This means that the total time to download is `(combined size of data dumps) / (internet speed) + (rate limiting) + (navigation overhead) + (time to solve captchas)`. While navigation overhead and rate limiting (hopefully) doesn't account for a significant share of time, it can potentially be significant. It's certainly a slower option than archive.org's torrent.


## Using the transformer

Once you've downloaded the data dumps, you may want to transform it into a more usable format than the data dump offers by default. This is where the transformer component comes in.

### Docker

This section assumes you have Docker installed, with [docker-compose-v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/).

A [default compose file](./docker-compose.yml) is provided for convenience. If you want to use a different one, set the `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable in a custom `.env` file in the project's root directory, or provide it on the command line. To start the container (and build it if not done already), run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

By default, this binds `downloads` and `out` in the current working directory to the container. If you want to change these paths, update the `volumes` attribute mapping of the `transformer` service in your compose file (or the default docker-compose.yml file if not using a custom one).

#### Environment variables

The following environment variables are used:

| Name               | Values         | Default | Description               |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `SEDD_OUTPUT_TYPE` | `json\|sqlite` | `json`  | Any upported output type. |
| `SPDLOG_LEVEL`     | log level      | `info`  | Sets the logging level.   |

If you want to override the defaults, either set them in a custom `.env` file in the project's root directory, or, if you have a UNIX shell (i.e. not cmd or PowerShell; Windows users can use Git Bash), you can explicitly provide them on the command line:

```bash
SEDD_OUTPUT_TYPE=sqlite docker compose up
```

If you want to rebuild the container, pass the `--build` flag to the docker command.

If you insist on using cmd or PowerShell instead of a good shell, setting the variables is left as an exercise to the reader.

### Native

#### Requirements

- C++20 compiler
- CMake 3.10 or newer

Other dependencies (stc, libarchive, spdlog, and pugixml) are automatically handled by CMake using FetchContent. Unlike the downloader, this component can run without a display.

##### Alternative install: pre-built binaries (Linux only)

For Linux users, there's a pre-provider binary distribution available per-release: https://github.com/LunarWatcher/se-data-dump-transformer/releases

For nightly versions, you still have to build it yourself. Additional binary distributions may be made available in the future, but C++ is hard to package. Note that this has the following additional native dependency requirements:

* `libcrypto`
* `libexpat`
* `libz`
* `libm`
* `libgcc_s`

Unless you're running an extremely minimal distro, you almost certainly have these preinstalled, or installed by something else. Note that the binaries have only been tested on Linux Mint.

#### Running

TL;DR:

```bash
cd transformer
mkdir build
cd build
# Option 1: debug:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
# Option 2: release mode; strongly recommended for anything that needs the performance:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# ---
# Replace 8 with the number of cores/threads you have
# Note: only Windows users are required to specify --config Release
cmake --build . -j 8 --config Release

# Note: this only works after running the Python downloader
# For early testing, I've been populating this folder with
# files from the old archive.org data dump.
# The last argument is the path to the downloaded data
# *UNIX:
./sedd-transformer -i ../../downloads -t [formatter type]
# Windows
.\sedd-transformer.exe -i ..\..\downloads -t [formatter type]
```

Pass `--help` to see the available formatters for your current version of the data dump transformer.

### Supported transformers

Currently, the following transformers are supported:

- `json`
- `sqlite`
  - Note: All data related to a site is merged into a single database. This results in some really fucking big SQLite files on big sites, with Stack Overflow's SQLite file being in excess of 200GB

## Language rationale

While I really didn't want to split the system over two programming languages, this is unfortunately the best way to go about it.

C++ does not really support Selenium, which is effectively a requirement for the download process. There are bindings, but all of them appear to be out-of-date, and I don't feel like writing an entire system for selenium

Python, on the other hand, infuriatingly doesn't support 7z streaming, at least not in a convenient format. There's the `libarchive` package, but it refuses to build. `python-libarchive` allegedly does, but [Windows support is flaky](https://github.com/smartfile/python-libarchive/issues/38), so the transformer might've had to be separated from the downloader anyway. There's py7zr, which does work everywhere, but it [doesn't support 7z streaming](https://github.com/miurahr/py7zr/issues/579).

7z and XML streaming are both _critical_ for the processing pipeline. If you plan to convert the entire data dump, you'll eventually run into `stackoverflow.com-PostHistory.7z`, which is 39GB compressed, and **181GB uncompressed** in the 2024 Q1 data dump. As time passes, this will likely continue to grow, and the absurd amounts of RAM required to just tank the full size [is barely supported on modern and _very_ high-end hardware](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/17hqk3k/what_happened_to_256gb_ram_capacity_motherboards/). Finding someone able to tank that is going to be difficult for the vast majority of people.

Consequently, direct `libarchive` support is beneficial, and rather than writing an entire new python wrapper (or taking over an existing one), it's easier to just write that part in C++. Also, since it might be easier to run this particular part in a Docker container to avoid downloading build tools on certain systems, having it be fully headless is an advantage.

On the bright side, this should mean faster processing compared to Python.

## License

The code is under the MIT license; see the `LICENSE` file.

The data downloaded and produced is under various versions of [CC-By-SA](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing), as per Stack Exchange's licensing rules, in addition to whatever extra rules they try to impose on the data dump.

[^1]: I've been unable to find the generator code, but I've also been unable to find a statement confirming that it's closed-source. It's possible it is open-source, but if it is, it's hard to find the source
[^2]: Only Postgres at the time of writing, with more planned
[^3]: Might work with earlier versions, but these are untested and not supported
