# Changelog

Only 2.2.0 and newer have explicitly recorded changelogs. For earlier versions, the releases may contain additional information.

## 2.2.0 (unreleased)

### Added
* `sedd` is now a script, so `python3 -m sedd` is no longer the only valid use form when installing from pypi, or when building and installing locally.
